# Road-Rage
My first project with unity: A Mad Max inspired race against time. Complete a run by finishing 3 laps around the track. Your fastest time is recorded and displayed as a ghost car to compete against in future runs. The game features a fully functional UI, a custom map built from scratch, and position based dynamic events.
